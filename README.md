# EletronicUrn
Eletronic Urn project from the Algorithms and Programming I course.

## Scope
Program created to simulate all the functions of an eletronic urn for voting. This urn must do basic functions through a main menu that lets the user insert candidates and voters for a voting simulation and then be able to compute the results for the mock election, revealing results for the winner and the percentage of total votes and voters that choose to pick no candidate. It is also able to inform the order of the voters and the parties that elected the most candidates and the least candidates.

## Funcionalites
The project in question was designed with 4 main funcionalities in mind: registering candidates and voters; voting; computing results; and showing some statistics about the results shown.
